This repository publishes trained models and sample programs for recognizing the Narutoâ€™s hand sign by using [YOLOX-Nano](https://github.com/Megvii-BaseDetection/YOLOX), one of the deep learning object detection models, for hand-sign recognition. The speed has been greatly improved compared to the Deep (using EfficientDet-D0).
